# 🧩 React Components

## 📌 What are React Components?

React **components** are **independent**, **reusable** pieces of UI code that help break down the user interface into smaller, manageable parts. You can use a component **anywhere** in your website or application.

## ⚙️ Key Rules

✅ Each component **must start with an uppercase letter** (e.g., `MyComponent`)  
This is how React knows it's a component and **not** a regular HTML tag.

❌ `mycomponent` → ❌ Not recognized as a component  
✅ `MyComponent` → ✅ Correct usage

## 🧪 My Work on Components

Here is some of my work on components — demonstrating the use of custom React elements, reusable layouts, and component-based design.

Feel free to explore the files and folders in this repository to see the components I’ve built.
I’ve worked on both basic and intermediate-level components to better understand how React works in real projects.
